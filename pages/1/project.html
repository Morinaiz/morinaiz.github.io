            <h1>Project Overview</h1>
            <p>Doors & Switches is my debut project, crafted during my first game jam participation.
                This 3D puzzle game centers around the collection and placement of spheres
                to manipulate doors within a Low Poly 3D Pixel-Art environment.<br><br>
                While many participants focused on 2D, I embraced 3D to stand out,
                offering a different perspective and experience within the game's thematic and technical limitations.</p>

            <h2>The Game</h2>
            <p>Leveraging my skills in Unreal Engine game development, I opted to focus on creating a 3D puzzle game.
                The game, themed around "ON/OFF," integrates this concept into its gameplay.
                Players navigate through a series of puzzles, using spheres to turn doors on (open them) or off (close them).

            <h2>Development Insights</h2>
            <p>Building under the time constraints of a one-week game jam, my focus was on delivering a solid, playable puzzle experience. While initial plans included adding more complex mechanics like moving platforms and enemies, the scope was refined to ensure completion within the deadline. I ensured the game adhered to the specific rules of the jam, including palette restrictions, resolution, engine compatibility, sound design, and control schemes.</p>
