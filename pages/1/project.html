        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>Doors & Switches is my debut project, crafted during my first game jam participation.
            In this 3D puzzle game you collect and place spheres to open doors.
            It's set in a Low Poly 3D Pixel-Art labyrinth.<br>
            While most of the participants focused on 2D, I decided to use 3D to stand out,
            as I thought it would be really fun to make a game using Unreal Engine in a Nokia Jam.</p>

        <h2>The Game</h2>
        <p>
            The game is completely 3D, using a shader to make the shaped of the various objects visible.
            Gameplay is simple, as you can only turn on and off the doors, since that was the theme of the jam (ON/OFF).<br>
            The decision to use Unreal Engine derived from my previous experience with it, especially with Shaders.
            Everything you see was done in a week, from gameplay, to shaders, to the idea.

        <h2>Development Insights</h2>
        <p>Building under the time constraints of a one-week game jam, my focus was on delivering a playable puzzle experience.
            While initial plans included adding more complex mechanics like moving platforms or elevators,
            the scope had to be reduced. The tight timeline was a problem since I had to spend much of the time working on the shaders.
            I made sure the game adhered 100% to the specific rules of the jam,
            including palette restrictions, resolution, sound design, and control schemes.</p>

        <h2>Technical Achievements</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Created the NOKIA 3310 Template for Unreal Engine 4, publicly available on my Github.</li>
            <li>Implemented shaders for Outline Detection, Pixelation, and Tonemapping to capture a distinctive visual style.</li>
            <li>Configured Sound Concurrency settings to replicate the classic monophonic audio reminiscent of the NOKIA 3310 era.</li>
            <li>Developed a custom player controller for the First-Person Character, enhancing the game's aesthetic.</li>
